## Political Boundaries Throughout History
This project will walk through the history of political boundaries in a certain region[s]
(i.e. The states of the United States of America, European countries throughout the 19th Century).

## Slider bar
We will utilize a slider bar, so that the user can scroll through the history of a
time period and new polygons will appear. There is a Leaflet plug-in, Leaflet.Slider,
that was created and maintained by EPP. It utilizes the following code template to
add a slider bar to an online map:

```
newSlider = L.control.slider(<Function> fn, <Control.Slider options> options);
```

This [webmap](https://www.timemaps.com/history/europe-1453ad/) is a good example of what we are trying to achieve.
