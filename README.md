## Austin Income and Crime
This project consists of an interactive web map of the city of Austin. Two layers, crime
and income, are displayed in the web map. Income is shown within census blocks by year in
the last decade. The census block layer is displayed as a choropleth map. The crime layer
is a point layer from the Austin Police Department by year in the last decade. It is displayed
as a heatmap using the ESRI heatmap renderer.

We have integrated a time slider so that when the user drags the slider to a certain year, that
year will apply to the data layers. Event-driven pop-up windows have also been utilized
so that when the user hovers over features in the data layers, they can gain more information.
